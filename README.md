# LoLLoginQueuePosition
Kinda useless. Parses the client logs, displays current login queue position and estimates the login time. Does not interact with the game. Should not violate ToS, but I take no responsibility.

Note that I have no time and absolutely no idea of WPF or C#, so the code is probably terrible and buggy.
